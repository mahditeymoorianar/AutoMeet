## What is it?
When we have some regular online classes or meetings, we should just open their links. For example if you have some online classes or meetings on your weekly plan, every week for each one you should remember the time and the links and find the link and type it in your browser, but here is an easier way! Use AutoMeet which opens the links of your online meetings and classes automatically in your defauld web browser a few minuts before they start.
